## Classification: Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbors, Feedforward Neural Networks

The Classification_Methods,Results.pdf explores three well-known supervised learning classifiers and their performance on data sets with different attributes. The MATLAB files for each classifier and for preprocessing the data are included.
